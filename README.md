# customer_rating_GUI
A new customer-rating program with very basic but greatly functioning GUI.

First of all: everything you sumbit and "export to database" will be stored in a database and could be exported/viewed later.
But first you'll have to fill out all the fields in order to submit.

The database works like an Excel or a Google Sheets file.

You can view the databse by simply pressing "Display Reviews" button

To delete your rating, you can display reviews and delete the review by the ID.
